# DailyDoseofBCA

DailyDoseofBCA is a web application designed to provide notes, assignments, and lab manuals for BCA students. It features a modern, responsive design with glassmorphism aesthetics and a secure authentication system.

## 🔐 Authentication System

The project now includes a robust authentication system using **Supabase**.

- **Login/Signup**: Users can create accounts and sign in via email/password.
- **Protected Content**: The main dashboard (`index.html`) is protected and requires login.
- **User Profiles**: Users can update their name and upload profile pictures.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Users stay logged in across page reloads.

### 📄 Documentation

We have created detailed guides to help you set up and manage the authentication system:

- **[AUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](AUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**: Step-by-step instructions to configure Supabase, set up the database, and deploy.
- **[AUTHENTICATION_SUMMARY.md](AUTHENTICATION_SUMMARY.md)**: Overview of features, user flows, and customization options.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository**.
2.  **Configure Supabase**: Follow the steps in [AUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md](AUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md) to create your project and get API credentials.
3.  **Update Credentials**: Replace the placeholder `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` in `auth.html` and `index.html` (if you haven't already).
4.  **Create Storage Bucket**: Create a public storage bucket named `avatars` in your Supabase dashboard for profile pictures.
5.  **Run Locally**: Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a local server like Live Server).
